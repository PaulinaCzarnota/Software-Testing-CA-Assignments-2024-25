This repository contains my CA assignments from the Software Testing module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin. 

# Assignment 1 Overview

This assignment focuses on unit testing the backend of the **TunePal music library API**, a system designed to manage a collection of songs with functionalities such as searching, pagination, and filtering. The primary objective was to ensure the correctness, reliability, and performance of core API functions by implementing comprehensive **unit tests** using Python’s `unittest` and `pytest` frameworks.  

Through structured testing, the following aspects of the API were validated: 

- **Song Management:** Adding new songs while preventing duplicates.  
- **Pagination:** Navigating through song listings efficiently.  
- **Search Functionality:** Searching by song title, artist, and handling special characters.  
- **Filtering:** Retrieving songs based on release year.  
- **Error Handling:** Managing invalid inputs gracefully.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring API response times remain ≤ 200ms.  
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Enforcing best practices using `pylint`.  

### Tools & Technologies Used:

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Testing Frameworks:** `unittest`, `pytest`  
- **Test Coverage Analysis:** `coverage`  
- **Code Quality Check:** `pylint`  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  

By following best practices in software testing, this project ensures robust, maintainable, and high-quality code for the TunePal API, preparing it for seamless integration with the front-end and further system testing.

Here’s a matching **Assignment 2 summary** you can add to your GitHub README, right after the Assignment 1 section:

# Assignment 2 Overview

This assignment focuses on **usability testing** of the TunePal mobile app, which is designed to identify, search, and manage traditional Irish music tunes. The aim was to apply formal software testing methodologies to evaluate and improve the app’s user experience based on real user interaction and feedback.

A structured **User Testing Plan** was developed and executed, involving defined personas, task-based usability scenarios, pre- and post-test questionnaires, and usability metrics such as the **System Usability Scale (SUS)**. This plan integrates techniques from academic sources, lab exercises, and user-centered design principles.

### Key Components:

- **Personas and Empathy Mapping:**  
  Developed two detailed user personas (Jane – beginner student, Cillian – experienced musician) supported by empathy maps to guide test design.

- **Usability Test Plan:**  
  Designed around Mayhew’s framework and the Think-Aloud Protocol (TAP), focusing on natural app usage and observing user behavior.

- **Test Materials:**  
  - Pre-Test Questionnaire  
  - Consent Form  
  - Moderator Script  
  - Task Sheet  
  - SUS Questionnaire  
  - Test Results Spreadsheet

- **Tasks Tested:**  
  - Tune searching and identification  
  - Using the microphone for recognition  
  - Saving to favourites  
  - Exporting sheet music  
  - Exploring the group feature

- **Results & Evaluation:**  
  SUS scores averaged **82.5/100**, indicating excellent usability. The findings revealed areas for UI and terminology improvements and confirmed the app's strong core experience.

### Tools & Methodologies Used:

- **User-Centered Design**  
- **Think-Aloud Protocol**  
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**  
- **Manual Task Observation & Error Tracking**  
- **Excel for Results Analysis**  
- **Visual Persona Design Tools**

This project demonstrates a professional approach to usability testing and iterative software improvement, placing end-users at the center of design decisions to ensure accessibility, clarity, and overall user satisfaction.
